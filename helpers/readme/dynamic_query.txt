Filters the library by query and sends results to a new playlist.
Similar to what foobar search or some search/filter plugins do.

Dynamic variables are allowed too, enclosed on '#':
#ARTIST#, #$year(%date%)#, ...
These placeholders will be replaced with focused item\'s result on execution.
Also allows working with multivalue tags by default,
Using TF expressions, multivalue tags are not converted, thus the expression is executed 'as is'.

Some examples: 
For a rock track, 'GENRE IS #GENRE#' would translate into 'GENRE IS Rock'.
The entire library would be filtered with tracks from that genre.

For a rock and electronic track, 'GENRE IS #GENRE#' would translate into '(GENRE IS Rock) AND (GENRE IS Electronic) '.
Note multi-value tags are splitted and produce multiple query entries by default. (*)

For a Dylan's track, 'COMPOSER IS #ARTIST#' would translate into 'COMPOSER IS Bob Dylan'.
And the entire library would be filtered with any track written by him.

(*) Since '#TAG# IS VALUE' forces tag to be equal to value, muti-value tags follow the same rationale.
If you want to use another logic (OR, combinations, etc.) between different values of the same tag
then the tool to use would be 'Search Same By'.
