Global Shortcuts is an experimental feature bypassing SMP limits. Really 'global', i.e. they work no matter what you are doing in foobar.
They stop working when foobar window is minimized... But still work if you 'alt-tab' between windows, even if foobar is not on screen.

As safeguard, key checking is temporarily disabled whenever you 'alt-tab'.
It will be re-enabled whenever the playlist tools button is clicked or manually, by pressing 'Ctrl + Shift + E' at any moment (as a switch).
