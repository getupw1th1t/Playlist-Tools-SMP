Shortcut button for Fingerprint Tools' entry.

Tag the currently selected tracks with fingerprints.
FooID or Chromaprint versions available.

For Chromaprint, the raw fingerprint is saved, not the
encoded version provided by default by fpcalc.exe or other
software like MusisBrainz Picard. Also the entire file
is fingerprinted, not just the first 120 secs.

FooID tagging: requires 'foo_biometric' to be installed 
on Foobar2000, 	along its 'Fooid.dll'. All files required
can be found at '_resources', along installation notes.
