Reorders selection to avoid consecutive tracks with the same configurable tag.
Can be used to scatter instrumental tracks, an specific genre, mood, etc.

Whenever the selection has so many tracks with that tag value, than scattering them
would not allow having at least one different valued track between them, it's left as is.
