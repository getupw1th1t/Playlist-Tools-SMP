Filters handle list or playlist using queries.
Similar to what foobar search or some search/filter plugins do.

On Playlist Tools dynamic variables are allowed too, enclosed on '#':
#ARTIST#, #$year(%date%)#, ...
These placeholders will be replaced with focused item\'s result on execution.

Some examples: 
For a rock track, 'GENRE IS #GENRE#' would translate into 'GENRE IS Rock'.
The entire playlist would be filtered with tracks from that genre.

For a Dylan's track, 'COMPOSER IS #ARTIST#' would translate into 'COMPOSER IS Bob Dylan'.
And the entire playlist would be filtered with any track written by him.
