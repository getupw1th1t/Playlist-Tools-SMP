Playlist creation similar to Random Pools component.
Multiple playlists \ library sources (pools) can be set to fill a destination playlist. 
Configurable selection length per source, query filtering, 
picking method (random, from start, from end) and final sorting of destination playlist. 

Usage:
	- Set source playlist(s) and other parameters.
		- Playlists matching the source names must exist to be used
		- As source name, _LIBRARY_#, where # is a number, may be used.
		- The query will be applied to the current source to get elegible tracks.
		- Dynamic queries may be used. i.e. 'GENRE IS #GENRE#'. (*)
		- Duplicates are removed after query (by artist|title|date).
		- Any track already selected for final playlist in previous steps is removed.
		- Finally tracks are choosen using the picking method set.
		- Source(s) with less tracks than pool(s) size will use all tracks.
	- Final playlist is created with tracks from all pools. 
	
(*) For a selected rock track, 'GENRE IS #GENRE#' would translate into 'GENRE IS Rock'.
Thus using the currently selected track to define the pool behavior. See 'Dynamic Query'.
